I've maintained open source projects for seven years. Some things I've learned.

The first contributor is the hardest to get. After that, the project gets some legitimacy and more come. Write a very explicit CONTRIBUTING.md. Most people want to help but don't know the preferred approach for something as simple as commit message format.

Issues will stay open forever unless you triage them. Pick a day of the week and close what isn't actionable. "Can't reproduce on current version" is a valid close reason. So is "this is by design."

Semver. People care about it more than you expect. A patch release that breaks something, even something undocumented, generates disproportionate frustration.

The bus factor problem is real. If only you can merge PRs, the project slows to your personal bandwidth. Adding a co-maintainer is scary (what if they make a decision you disagree with?) and also necessary.

Burnout happens. Sometimes a project needs to be archived. There's no shame in it. A clear README that says "this project is no longer maintained" is genuinely better than silence.
